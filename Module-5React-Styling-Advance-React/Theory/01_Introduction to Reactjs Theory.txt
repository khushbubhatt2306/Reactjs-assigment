Question 1: What is React.js? How is it different from other JavaScript frameworks and
libraries?
=>React.js is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for web applications. React JS is a open source JavaScript Library for create Reusable Components.
- React.js is a library focused only on building user interfaces, while many other frameworks (like Angular or Vue) are full-featured and handle everything, including routing and state management. React’s use of the Virtual DOM makes it faster and more efficient compared to direct DOM manipulation used by others.

Question 2: Explain the core principles of React such as the virtual DOM and componentbased architecture.
=>1. Virtual DOM
The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the real DOM.
React updates this Virtual DOM first whenever something changes in the UI.
Then, it compares the Virtual DOM with the real DOM, calculates the difference, and updates only the parts that changed.
This makes updates faster and more efficient.

- 2. Component-Based Architecture
React applications are built using components.
A component is like a building block that represents a part of the user interface (e.g., a button, form, or navbar).
Each component is reusable and manages its own logic and state.
By combining components, you can create complex UIs in a modular and organized way.

Question 3: What are the advantages of using React.js in web development?
=> Reusable Components: Build small, reusable pieces of UI to save time and effort.
- Fast Performance: The Virtual DOM ensures quick updates and smooth performance.
- Easy to Use: React’s simple syntax and component-based structure make it beginner-friendly.
- SEO-Friendly: Supports server-side rendering for better search engine rankings.
- Large Community: Plenty of resources, tools, and support available.
- Cross-Platform: Use React for both web apps and mobile apps with React Native.
