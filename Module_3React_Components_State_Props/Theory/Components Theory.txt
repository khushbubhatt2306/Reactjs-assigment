Question 1: What are components in React? Explain the difference between functional
components and class components.
=> components in React are reusable code we can use whenever we need to call.
it is a block of code.
-> Functional Components:
 - Simple JavaScript functions that return JSX.
 - we can use hooks (e.g., useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle.
 - Easier to write and read, with less boilerplate code.
 - Lightweight and faster.	
 - Use hooks like useEffect instead of lifecycle methods.

-> Class Components
 - JavaScript classes that extend React.Component.
 - Manage state using this.state and lifecycle.
 - More verbose due to the class syntax.
 - Slightly heavier due to class overhead.	

Question 2: How do you pass data to a component using props?
=>You pass data to a component using props by adding attributes to the component tag, similar to how you add attributes in HTML. The data can then be accessed inside the component using props.

Example:
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

// Passing data via props
<Welcome name="John" />


Question 3: What is the role of render() in class components?
=>The render() method in class components is used to define what the UI should look like. It returns the JSX that React will display on the screen.
