Question 1: How do you render a list of items in React? Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?
=>In React, you can render a list by using the .map() function to loop through an array and return JSX elements for each item.
-> Why is it important to use keys when rendering lists?
 Keys help React identify which list items have changed, been added, or removed, making updates faster and more efficient. Without keys, React may re-render the entire list unnecessarily, leading to performance issues and UI bugs. Using unique keys ensures smooth updates and prevents unexpected behavior. 

Question 2: What are keys in React, and what happens if you do not provide a unique key?
=>Keys are special attributes in React used to uniquely identify items in a list. They help React track changes efficiently when rendering dynamic lists.

-> what happens if you do not provide a unique key?
Performance Issues – React may re-render the entire list instead of updating only the changed items.
UI Bugs – Items may be reordered incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior.
React Warning – React will show a warning in the console:
"Each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop."
